### Superscripts:
 **1:** Unpack with 'f' and 'd' key can return NaN. The value NAN is used to represent a value that is an error. This is represented when exponent field is all ones with a zero sign bit or a mantissa that it not 1 followed by zeros. This is a special value that might be used to denote a variable that doesnâ€™t yet hold a value.
